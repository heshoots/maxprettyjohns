The vinyl wrap on my fightstick is now complete, as you can see in the
picture above. When I started this there were no guidance on doing
this with a fightstick, so I will give some here.

Firstly, I really recommend watching some of Avalon's "Wrap It Right"
videos, the advice is great and very helpful with some parts of the
stick corners and deep channels especially. Also, do not rush it, a
good job may take many hours to complete successfully. I spent about 5
hours on mine rushing towards the end, this lead to some bad results
and mistakes.

To begin disassemble your stick into the smallest parts. For a TE
fightstick detach the side panels, top, bottom, cable compartment and
compartment flap. It will also help to remove the plexi top, detaching
the cables. This is where I made my first mistake, be very careful
with the header cable for your JLF stick, I accidentally pulled a
cable from the header. Causing a massive wiring headache to get the
stick to work again. You will also need to remove the start and back
buttons.

If you haven't performed a vinyl wrap before, I recommend starting
with the cable compartment flap. This is an easier piece and wastes
very little material if you get it wrong. Also make sure you cut much
more material than you need for each part. This will give you
something to hold on to when heating and stretching, it also leaves
some to leave over the edge, holding the vinyl in place.

Some areas caused me problems and you may want to be a little more
careful when working on them. The sides were where I started my wrap,
The corners were very hard to get right first time, make sure you use
plenty of heat to get the vinyl to stretch around the corner and then
squeegee flat areas to suit the corner. This will give a much nicer
corner. Also be careful with the top, bottom and side joins. The edges
need to be very well done to fit together nicely. Mine are
inconsistent and give a wavy effect. And finally, the small edges
around the bottom plate. I think it would be better to do these small
strips early, and then cover the edge with the vinyl from the front
and back of the bottom piece, I did them last and they do not seem
very secure.

I hope these tips were helpful to you and I hope your wrap goes well!
