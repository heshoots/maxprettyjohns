excerpt: Going over some of the modifications i will be doing with my fightstick over the next few months.

I currently play on a Madcatz Soul Calibur 5: Soul Edition fightstick.
The stick itself rocks, but im not personally a Soul Calibur fan and
am becoming a bit bored of the design. I have a few plans to modify
the stick over the coming months, I will outline them here.

I will begin by wrapping the outer shell in some pink vinyl wrap, this
seems pretty simple if i can figure out wrapping the sharp corners.
Taking it apart to wrap sould make it much simpler.

Once the wrap has been done I will laser cut a new full plexi top, allowing
me to remove the grey outer bezel and give a new cleaner look. This
may require minor modification to the xbox guide/turbo area of the
top, hopefully this will be simple. Either lowering it to fit flush
with the new top or moving it to another area on the stick. At this
point I will cut the top to only have 4 screw holes since I am missing
a screw and this should give a cleaner look. Finally adding my custom
artwork underneath.

Finally, I will dual mod the stick to allow for ps3 play, I may delay
this if there has been no news from SF5 with regards to ps3 controller
support.
